### Project overview
Biopsy prostate cancer diagnosis: automating prostate cancer diagnosis on whole-slide image biopsy using patches extraction and TensorFlow

*keywords : Healthcare, digital pathology, prostate cancer, Google Colab, TensorFlow, EfficientNet, TPU, Udacity*

### Main documents
- **[Capstone proposal](./proposal)**
- **[Capstone report](./report)**
- **Notebooks:**
    - [PANDA 1 - Extract patches from WSI](./PANDA%201%20-%20Extract%20patches%20from%20WSI.ipynb)
    - [PANDA 2 - Export patches to TFRecords](./PANDA%202%20-%20Export%20patches%20to%20TFRecords.ipynb)
    - [PANDA 3 - CNN training on TPU](./PANDA%203%20-%20CNN%20training%20on%20TPU.ipynb)
    - [PANDA 4 - Kaggle model inference](./PANDA%204%20-%20Kaggle%20model%20inference.ipynb)
 
### Usage
The notebook are all autonomous and will install any necessary dependancies. Notebooks 1 to 3 should be run on [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Notebook 4 is runnable as [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

You will also need a a [Google cloud storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage) to store generated patches. For convenience, already generated patches are publicly available with read-only access.

They are also directly accessibles following these read-only links:
