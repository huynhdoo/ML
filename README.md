# ML - Machine Learning Portfolio
I reference in this repository all my Machine learning projects

## [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/huynhdoo/ML/tree/master/sentiment-analysis)
**Udacity Machine learning Engineer Nanodegree project.** 
A recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. Using PyTorch on Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, a simple web app interact via API endpoint with the deployed model on AWS.

*Keywords : SageMaker, AWS, PyTorch, RNN, DeepLearning, Udacity*

## [Plagiarism detection](https://github.com/huynhdoo/ML/tree/master/plagiarism-detection)
**Udacity Machine learning Engineer Nanodegree project.**
A plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.

*keywords : SageMaker, AWS, Feature engineering, Scikitlearn, GradientBoosting, Udacity*

## [Prostate cancer diagnosis](https://github.com/huynhdoo/ML/tree/master/prostate-cancer-diagnosis)
**Udacity Machine learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone project.**
An AI web application using deep learning model that can read a prostate biopsy image and return a possible diagnosis of Gleason score/ISUP grade to the end-user.

*keywords : Healthcare, digital pathology, prostate cancer, pyTorch, CNN, Udacity*
